### Step 1: Get Your Airtable Credentials

1. **Get your API Token:**
   - Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens
   - Click "Create new token"
   - Name it: "Liturgist Signup App"
   - Add these scopes:
     - `data.records:read`
     - `data.records:write`
   - Add access to your "Liturgist Signups" base
   - Click "Create token"
   - **COPY THE TOKEN** (starts with `pat...`)

2. **Get your Base ID:**
   - Go to https://airtable.com/api
   - Click on your "Liturgist Signups" base
   - The Base ID is shown in the introduction (starts with `app...`)
   - Or look in the URL: `https://airtable.com/[BASE_ID]/api/docs`

### Step 2: Add Credentials to .env.local

Open the file `.env.local` in your project and add your credentials:

```env
AIRTABLE_PAT_TOKEN=your_pat_token_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=liturgists.ukiahumc.org
```

Replace with your actual values:

```env
AIRTABLE_PAT_TOKEN=pat...
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app...
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=liturgists.ukiahumc.org
```

### Step 3: Restart the Dev Server
