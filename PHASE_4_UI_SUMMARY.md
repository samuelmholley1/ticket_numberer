- `USDAFood` - Complete food object from USDA API
- `NutrientProfile` - 30+ nutrients for nutrition labels
- `Ingredient` - Individual ingredient with quantity/unit
- `SubRecipe` - Complete sub-recipe with nutrition
- `FinalDish` - Complete final dish (not yet used)

**Note:** Types file still named `liturgist.ts` (legacy naming). Should be renamed to `nutrition.ts` or `index.ts` in future cleanup.

## What's NOT Yet Implemented (Need API Routes)

### Missing Backend APIs:
1. **`/api/usda/search`** - Search USDA FoodData Central
   - Already built in `src/lib/usda.ts` (searchFoods function)
   - Just needs Next.js API route wrapper

2. **`/api/sub-recipes` GET** - Fetch all sub-recipes from Airtable
   - Needs Airtable base setup
   - Query SubRecipes table

3. **`/api/sub-recipes` POST** - Save new sub-recipe to Airtable
   - Needs Airtable base setup
   - Insert into SubRecipes table

4. **`/api/sub-recipes/calculate` POST** - Calculate nutrition profile
   - Use `src/lib/calculator.ts` (calculateNutritionProfile)
   - Fetch USDA data for each ingredient
   - Apply yield adjustments

5. **`/api/sub-recipes/{id}` GET** - Fetch single sub-recipe details
   - For detail page (not yet built)

6. **`/api/sub-recipes/{id}` DELETE** - Delete sub-recipe from Airtable
   - Already called from list page
   - Just needs implementation

## User Experience Flow (Current State)

### Happy Path (When APIs Implemented):
1. User lands on new homepage
2. Clicks "Create Your First Recipe"
3. Searches for ingredients (e.g., "chicken breast")
4. Adds 3-5 ingredients with quantities
5. Enters raw weight (500g) and final weight (400g, 80% yield)
6. Sets serving size (100g = 4 servings)
7. Clicks "Save Sub-Recipe"
8. Redirected to Sub-Recipes list page
9. Sees new card with nutrition preview
10. Can click "View Details" to see full nutrition label

### Current State (Without APIs):
- Homepage ‚úÖ Works (static content)
- Ingredient search ‚ùå No results (API not implemented)
- Sub-recipe builder ‚úÖ UI works, ‚ùå Save fails (API not implemented)
- Sub-recipes list ‚ùå Empty (Airtable not set up)

## Design Decisions

### Color Palette:
- **Primary:** Emerald 600 (#059669) - Food industry standard, evokes freshness
- **Secondary:** Blue 600 (#2563eb) - Trust, professionalism
- **Gradients:** Emerald-to-blue backgrounds
- **Feature Cards:** Pastel gradients (blue, emerald, purple, amber, rose, indigo)

### Typography:
- **Headlines:** Bold, large (text-4xl to text-6xl)
- **Body:** Gray-700/600 for readability
- **CTAs:** Semibold or bold for emphasis

### Component Architecture:
- **Client Components:** All interactive UI (`'use client'` directive)
- **Reusable Components:** IngredientSearch can be used in Final Dishes too
- **Form Management:** react-hook-form for complex forms (Sub-Recipe builder)
- **State Management:** useState for simple state, react-hook-form for form state

### Responsive Design:
- **Mobile-first:** All components work on mobile
- **Grid breakpoints:** `md:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3`
- **Max widths:** `max-w-5xl` for forms, `max-w-7xl` for lists
- **Tailwind CSS:** All styling via utility classes

## Next Steps (Phase 4 Continued)

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Create API Routes** (2-3 hours):
   - `/api/usda/search` - Wrapper around `src/lib/usda.ts`
   - `/api/sub-recipes` - CRUD routes for Airtable
   - `/api/sub-recipes/calculate` - Nutrition calculation

2. **Wait for Airtable Setup** (User Task):
   - User creates "Nutrition App" base
   - User runs `yarn tsx scripts/setup-airtable-base.ts`
   - User adds env vars to Vercel
   - Redeploy

3. **Test End-to-End Flow**:
   - Create sub-recipe
   - Search ingredients
   - Save successfully
   - View in list
   - Delete

### Phase 4 Remaining (Day 3-5):
- **Final Dish Builder Page** (`/final-dishes/new`)
  - Similar to sub-recipe builder
  - Add sub-recipes as ingredients
  - Add raw ingredients
  - Generate nutrition label
  
- **Final Dishes List Page** (`/final-dishes`)
  - Similar to sub-recipes list
  - Allergen display
  - Export label functionality

- **Nutrition Label Integration**
  - Already built (`src/components/NutritionLabel.tsx`)
  - Just needs to be added to Final Dish detail pages

## Files Changed

### New Files:
1. `src/app/page.tsx` (replaced)
2. `src/app/page_liturgist_backup.tsx` (backup)
3. `src/components/IngredientSearch.tsx`
4. `src/app/sub-recipes/page.tsx`
5. `src/app/sub-recipes/new/page.tsx`

### Modified Files:
1. `src/types/liturgist.ts` (added USDA and nutrition types)

### Total Lines Added: ~2,200 lines

## Summary

**Phase 4 Day 1-2: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

We've successfully implemented the core UI for the nutrition label calculator. The homepage, ingredient search, and sub-recipe management pages are fully functional on the frontend. The next step is to build the API routes and connect to Airtable once the database is set up.

**User Impact:** Can now see the vision of the app and interact with the UI. Just needs backend integration to become fully functional.

**Time Saved by AI CTO's Plan:** The MIGRATION_PLAN.md provided a clear roadmap for Phase 4, which we followed to build these components efficiently.

**Ready for:** API route implementation and Airtable integration.
