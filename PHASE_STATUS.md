## 🐛 VULNERABILITIES TO TEST (Red Team)

### UI/UX Vulnerabilities

#### Sub-Recipe Builder (`/sub-recipes/new`)
1. **Recipe Paste Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Test with malformed recipe text (no units, weird formats)
   - [ ] Test with 50+ ingredients (performance)
   - [ ] Test with ingredients that have no USDA match
   - [ ] Test with duplicate ingredient names
   - [ ] Test with special characters in ingredient names
   - [ ] Test with very long ingredient names (>100 chars)

2. **Manual Ingredient Addition**
   - [ ] What happens if user doesn't select USDA ingredient before adding?
   - [ ] What happens if quantity is 0 or negative?
   - [ ] What happens if user types invalid number format?
   - [ ] Can user submit form with 0 ingredients?
   - [ ] Can user submit without setting weights?

3. **Weight Calculations**
   - [ ] What if rawWeight > finalWeight (impossible yield)?
   - [ ] What if both weights are 0?
   - [ ] What if servingSize > finalWeight?
   - [ ] What if servingSize is 0?

4. **Form Validation**
   - [ ] Can submit without recipe name?
   - [ ] Can submit with only whitespace in name?
   - [ ] What's the max recipe name length?
   - [ ] What happens if Airtable save fails?
   - [ ] Is there a "saving" state to prevent double-submit?

#### Sub-Recipe List (`/sub-recipes`)
1. **Data Display**
   - [ ] What if no sub-recipes exist (empty state)?
   - [ ] What if a sub-recipe has 0 servings?
   - [ ] What if nutrition values are null/undefined?
   - [ ] How does it handle very long recipe names?

2. **Search/Filter**
   - [ ] Does search work with special characters?
   - [ ] What if search returns 0 results?
   - [ ] Is search case-sensitive (should it be)?

3. **Delete Action**
   - [ ] Is there confirmation before delete?
   - [ ] What happens if delete fails?
   - [ ] Are sub-recipes used in final dishes protected?

#### Ingredient Search Component
1. **Search Behavior**
   - [ ] What if USDA API is down?
   - [ ] What if search returns 0 results?
   - [ ] What if search returns 1000+ results?
   - [ ] Does debounce work correctly?
   - [ ] Can user trigger multiple searches simultaneously?

2. **Result Selection**
   - [ ] What if user clicks result twice quickly?
   - [ ] What if result data is incomplete (missing nutrition)?
   - [ ] What happens with very long food names?

#### Recipe Paste Component
1. **Parser Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Recipe with no name (just ingredients)
   - [ ] Recipe with name but no ingredients
   - [ ] Recipe with ingredients but no units
   - [ ] Recipe with only volume units (cups, tbsp) - how accurate?
   - [ ] Recipe with fractions (1/2, 1 1/4, etc.)
   - [ ] Recipe with unicode characters
   - [ ] Recipe with HTML/special chars

2. **USDA Auto-Search**
   - [ ] What if all ingredients fail to match USDA?
   - [ ] What if USDA rate limit is hit during batch search?
   - [ ] What if user pastes 100 ingredients?
   - [ ] Is there a timeout for slow searches?

### Functional Vulnerabilities

#### Calculator Logic
1. **Unit Conversions**
   - [ ] Test all unit conversions (g, oz, lb, cup, tbsp, tsp, ml)
   - [ ] Test with 0 quantity
   - [ ] Test with negative quantity
   - [ ] Test with very large numbers (999999)
   - [ ] Test with very small decimals (0.001)

2. **Nutrition Calculation**
   - [ ] Test with ingredient missing nutrition data
   - [ ] Test with 0g serving size
   - [ ] Test with yield multiplier > 1 (food expands?)
   - [ ] Test with yield multiplier = 0
   - [ ] Test recursive sub-recipes (sub-recipe in sub-recipe)

3. **FDA Rounding**
   - [ ] Test boundary cases for all nutrients
   - [ ] Test with 0 values
   - [ ] Test with very large values
   - [ ] Verify "< 1g" and "0g" display correctly

#### API Routes
1. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Test all API routes with missing auth (if applicable)
   - [ ] Test with malformed JSON body
   - [ ] Test with missing required fields
   - [ ] Test with invalid data types
   - [ ] Test with SQL injection attempts (Airtable should handle)

2. **USDA API**
   - [ ] Test with rate limiting
   - [ ] Test with invalid API key
   - [ ] Test with network timeout
   - [ ] Test with empty search query
   - [ ] Test with very long search query (>1000 chars)

3. **Sub-Recipe Endpoints**
   - [ ] Test GET with 0 records
   - [ ] Test GET with 1000+ records (pagination needed?)
   - [ ] Test POST with duplicate names
   - [ ] Test PUT with non-existent ID
   - [ ] Test DELETE with non-existent ID

#### Data Integrity
1. **Airtable Schema**
   - [ ] Test with missing linked records (SubRecipeLinks)
   - [ ] Test with invalid allergen values
   - [ ] Test with invalid status values
   - [ ] Test with very long text fields

2. **Type Safety**
   - [ ] Are all API responses typed correctly?
   - [ ] Are null/undefined handled everywhere?
   - [ ] Are numbers that should be strings (IDs) handled?

### Performance Vulnerabilities

1. **Large Datasets**
   - [ ] Sub-recipe with 100 ingredients
   - [ ] Final dish with 50 sub-recipes
   - [ ] 1000+ sub-recipes in database
   - [ ] Recipe paste with 200 ingredients

2. **Network Issues**
   - [ ] Slow USDA API response
   - [ ] Slow Airtable response
   - [ ] Multiple simultaneous API calls
   - [ ] Browser back button during save

3. **Memory Issues**
   - [ ] Long session with many searches
   - [ ] Multiple browser tabs open
   - [ ] Large images in nutrition labels (future)

### Browser Compatibility

1. **Cross-Browser**
   - [ ] Chrome (latest)
   - [ ] Safari (latest)
   - [ ] Firefox (latest)
   - [ ] Edge (latest)
   - [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
   - [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

   - [ ] Laptop (1366x768)
   - [ ] Tablet (768x1024)
   - [ ] Mobile (375x667)
   - [ ] Mobile landscape

### Accessibility

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - [ ] Can tab through all forms
   - [ ] Can select ingredients with keyboard
   - [ ] Can submit forms with Enter
   - [ ] Can cancel with Escape

2. **Screen Readers**
   - [ ] All images have alt text
   - [ ] Form fields have labels
   - [ ] Buttons have descriptive text
   - [ ] Error messages are announced

2. **Red Team Testing** - Work through vulnerability checklist
3. **Add Env Vars to Vercel** - Deploy fully functional app
4. **User Testing** - Get feedback from real users
5. **Polish UI** - Improve error messages and loading states
