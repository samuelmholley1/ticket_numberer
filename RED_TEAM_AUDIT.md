## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Input Validation Vulnerabilities ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH - Can crash application
**Location:** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/NumberingPreview.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- Ticket count accepts negative numbers, zero, or extremely large values
- Start number can be negative
- No bounds checking on font size (can cause rendering failures)
- File size validation exists but error handling is poor

**Impact:**
- Browser crashes with large numbers
- Memory exhaustion
- Poor user experience

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added to page.tsx - ticket count validation
const validatedCount = Math.max(1, Math.min(500, count))
if (validatedCount !== count) {
  toast.warning('Ticket count adjusted to valid range (1-500)')
}

// Added to NumberingPreview.tsx - start number validation
if (value < 1) {
  toast.warning('Start number must be at least 1')
  return
}
if (value > 999999) {
  toast.warning('Start number cannot exceed 999,999')
  return
}

// Added to NumberingPreview.tsx - font size validation
if (value < 12) {
  toast.warning('Font size must be at least 12px')
  return
}
if (value > 120) {
  toast.warning('Font size cannot exceed 120px')
  return
}
```

### 2. Memory Exhaustion Risk ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH - Can freeze browser tabs
**Location:** `src/components/ExportProgress.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- All ticket generation happens synchronously in main thread
- No batching for large exports (500 tickets = 500 canvas operations)
- No progress indication for long-running operations
- No cancellation mechanism

**Impact:**
- Browser becomes unresponsive
- Users lose work
- High bounce rate

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented batch processing (5 tickets per batch)
- Added proper async handling with `setTimeout` yields
- Added working cancellation mechanism
- Maintained progress tracking and error recovery
- Browser remains responsive during large exports

### 3. No Error Recovery ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Poor user experience
**Location:** Throughout application

**Issues Found:**
- Generic error messages ("Failed to export files")
- No retry mechanisms
- No graceful degradation
- Errors don't provide actionable feedback

**Impact:**
- Users abandon tool when errors occur
- No way to recover from failures
- Low trust in reliability

**Fix Applied:**
- Added specific error messages for CORS, network, memory, and canvas failures
- Implemented automatic retry with 2-second delay for recoverable errors
- Added "Retry All Failed" button for bulk error recovery
- Provided actionable error messages with suggested solutions
- Improved error handling throughout the export process

- No touch event handlers
- UI not optimized for mobile screens
- File upload may not work properly on mobile

**Impact:**
- Mobile users can't use core functionality
- Lost revenue from mobile users
- Poor app store ratings if PWA

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive touch event handlers (onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd, onTouchCancel)
- Implemented touch-based drag positioning with same position clamping as mouse
- Added preventDefault() on touch move to prevent unwanted scrolling
- Updated aria-label to include "tap" option for mobile users
- Touch events mirror mouse event coordinates for consistent positioning
- Touch end properly applies final position just like mouse up

### 6. No Undo/Redo Functionality ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** LOW - Quality of life issue
**Location:** `src/components/NumberingPreview.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- No way to revert position changes
- No way to undo settings changes
- Mistakes require complete restart

**Impact:**
- Frustrating user experience
- Increased support requests
- Users avoid experimenting

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented undo/redo history stack for all settings changes
- Added Undo/Redo buttons in modal UI
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z (Undo), Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z (Redo)
- Proper history management - new changes after undo clear future history
- Disabled buttons when at start/end of history
- Visual feedback with tooltip hints
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS (Nice to Have)

### 7. Loading States Missing ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** LOW - UX polish
**Location:** `src/components/CanvaImport.tsx`, `src/components/NumberingPreview.tsx`, `src/components/ExportProgress.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- No loading indicators for template loading
- No progress feedback for file processing
- Abrupt state changes

**Impact:**
- Users unsure if actions are working
- Perceived slowness

**Fix Applied:**
- Animated loading spinners for file uploads and template loading
- Progress bars and percentage tracking for export generation
- Live progress updates showing completed/failed/pending tickets
- Loading state messages ("Uploading...", "Processing...", "Generating...")
- Live regions for screen reader announcements of progress
- Visual status indicators for each ticket
- Proper state transitions with no abrupt changes

### 8. Font Preview Not Real-time ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** LOW - Feature enhancement
**Location:** `src/components/NumberingPreview.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- Font changes don't update preview immediately
- No live preview of settings changes
- Requires modal interaction

**Impact:**
- Trial and error workflow
- Slower iteration

**Fix Applied:**
- Live preview updates implemented with useEffect dependency array
- Preview regenerates whenever any setting changes (position, font, color, format)
- Real-time updates for all font properties
- Performance optimized with efficient rendering

### 9. No Settings Persistence ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** LOW - Convenience feature
**Location:** `src/app/page.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- All settings lost on page refresh
- No way to save preferences
- Repeated work for power users

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience for frequent users
- Lost productivity

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented localStorage integration in src/app/page.tsx
- Automatically saves user preferences on every change
- Automatically loads saved preferences on page load
- Saves: ticket count, number format, and number position
- Graceful error handling if localStorage is unavailable
- Preferences persist across browser sessions

### 10. Export Size Estimation Wrong ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** LOW - Information accuracy
**Location:** `src/components/NumberingPreview.tsx`

**Issues Found:**
- ZIP size calculation doesn't account for image complexity
- Estimates are inaccurate
- No dynamic calculation

**Impact:**
- Users surprised by file sizes
- Potential storage issues

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented dynamic size calculation based on actual image dimensions
- Formula: (width × height × 4 bytes × 0.15 compression ratio × count) + (5KB metadata × count)
- Accounts for PNG compression efficiency (typically 10-30%, using conservative 15%)
- Now accurately reflects different image sizes instead of fixed 150KB per ticket

## 🟡 POST-LAUNCH ISSUES (Found During Testing)

### Issue #11: Edit Mode UI Broken ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks core functionality
**Location:** `src/components/NumberingPreview.tsx`

**Issues Found During Preview Testing:**
1. ✅ **Number size doubles** - FIXED: Exact preview scaling with `fontSize * (imageHeight / imgHeight)`
2. ✅ **White fade/overlay appears** - FIXED: Removed bg-white bg-opacity-90
3. ✅ **No drag indicator emoji** - FIXED: Added white pointing hand SVG with smart positioning
4. ✅ **Image fades when dragging** - FIXED: Added overflow: hidden and GPU rendering hints

**Complete Fix Applied (Milestone: commit c923bb4):**
- **Exact preview scaling**: Number renders at exact same size as final output using `fontSize * (imageHeight / imgHeight)`
- **Bold text consistency**: Number renders with `fontWeight: 'bold'` matching preview
- **White pointing hand**: Replaced emoji with proper SVG cursor positioned outside border
- **Smart positioning**: Hand jumps to opposite side when near edges to avoid cutoff
- **Image stability**: Added `overflow: hidden` and `will-change: auto` to prevent fading artifacts
- **User-configurable border**: Added border color picker for customization (nice-to-have optimization)

**Resolution Confirmed:**
All UX/UI issues in edit mode are now resolved. Users can see realistic previews before saving, drag indicators are intuitive, and no visual artifacts occur during interaction.
